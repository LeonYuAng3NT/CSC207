Each one of you is responsible for adding a file in this folder every three days with the following contents: Do not ask your colleague to commit for you. That won't count. 

a) What did I work on last time? 

b) What do I plan to work on now?  

c) Am I blocked on anything?  


Example1: 

What did I do last time?
    - worked on JShell and FileOperation
    - brainstormed design ideas with team for echo and mkdir commands. 

What do I plan to do now?
    - finish JShell and FileOperation
    - work on new tasks for sprint 2
        - start and finish Man, Echo, Mv

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need FileSystem, StandardOutput, StandardError, and Command to be completed (or at least prototyped) before I can continue working

 
The filename for this will be: 
CDFUserNameSprint#Date.txt

for example:

c1abcxyzSprint1October17.txt

where c1abcxyz=CDFUserName
      1 in Sprint1=Sprint #
