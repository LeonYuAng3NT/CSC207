What did I do last time?
    - Demonstrate and share idea about test void method
    - Recommended team to change return type of String for all the
      method which will print out the result
    - Refactor some methods to use the new method from Interface of
      OutputProducer

What do I plan to do now?
	- Finish debugging and refactor as soon as possible

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Design style is not certainly confirmed
