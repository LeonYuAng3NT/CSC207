What did I do last time?
    - Use Stack module from Java JDK to implement directory stack
      in FileSystem instead of using DirectoryStack
    - Start implement JUnit test cases
    - Demonstrate a new way to implement the JShell with the forName method
      and instance method in Class.
    - Enhanced the readability and javadoc of completed class

What do I plan to do now?
    - Finish the JUnit test cases

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Analyze and discover the test cases that is able to cover
      all the possibilities of mistake
