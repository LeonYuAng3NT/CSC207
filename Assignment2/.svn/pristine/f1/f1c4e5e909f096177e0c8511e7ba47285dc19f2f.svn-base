What did I do last time?
	- Update several Junit Test from A2a.
	- Discuss with group members about the design of A2b.

What do I plan to do now?
	- Continue working on writing the tests.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - If an interface for StringPrinter is necessary
    (Or just have method for each command class needed)
