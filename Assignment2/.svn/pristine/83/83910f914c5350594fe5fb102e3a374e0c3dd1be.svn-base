What did I do last time?
    - I shared ideas to design CRC cards.
    - Updated the CRC card design, but not submitted yet.

What do I plan to do now?
	- Start and Finish MakeDirectory class.(next time)
	- Start and Finish ListContent class.(next time)

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Not sure about if the design actually works, need following check.
    - Not sure if FileSystem is necessary for our design.
    	-Not able to write MakeDirectory until 
    	 I can figure out if FileSystem is necessary
