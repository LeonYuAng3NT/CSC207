What did I do last time?
	- Meet with team and assigned tasks for sprint 2.
	- Wrote the base code for DirectoryNavigator class.
	
What do I plan to do now?
    - Implement unit test for the DirectoryNavigator class and make this class to function.
    - Improve and finish the DirectoryNavigator class

Am I blocked on anything?
    - The design might not be ideal, huge changes might be made. Need further discussion with the team.
