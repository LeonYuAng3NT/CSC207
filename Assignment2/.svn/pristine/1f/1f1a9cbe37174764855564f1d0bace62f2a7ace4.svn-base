-JUnit tests from last Sprint have not completed




Specific tasks to be accomplished:
e-1. (ContentViewer) Write the method for recursively traversing sub-directories
e-2. (ContentViewer) Write JUnit test for ContentViewer specifically the method
                     relates to recursive traversal.
e-3  (ContentViewer) Allow JShell to catch Exceptions thrown from ContentViewer.
f-1. (History) Write the base code for storing users' input.
f-2. (History) Develop the functionality of displaying specific history.
f-3. (History) Run basic tests to ensure the functionality in normal and
                  special cases.
f-4  (History) Write the JUnit test cases for History.
g-1. (RegexFinder) Write the base code for RegFinder.
g-2. (RegexFinder) Develop the method that recursively traverses the path given
                   and find specific regular expression
g-3  (RegexFinder) Write the JUnit test cases for RegexFinder.
h-1. (FileReader) Write the execute() method so that the JShell is able to 

h-2. (FileReader) Write the JUnit test cases that consists of multiple files 
i-1  (PathChecker) Implement the method in PathChecker class in order to check the
                   validity of path in redirection
i-2  (PathChecker) Build the connection between FileEditor and PathChecker and 
                    therefore improve the functionality of actual redirection
