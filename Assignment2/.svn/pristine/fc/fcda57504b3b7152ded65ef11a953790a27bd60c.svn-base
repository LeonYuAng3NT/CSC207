What did I do last time?
	- Meet with team and decided to leave the implementation of unit tests after each group member finish their classes.
	- Implement modification for the ContentViewer, WorkingPathPrinter, and DirectoryNavigator classes.
	- Worked on base code of the HistoryViewer class. 
	
What do I plan to do now?
    - Ask questions our team have on the design during the Monday tutorial.
    - Confirm the design with team and change base code for the classes if necessary to be prepare for the Sprint 3.
    - Finish the HistoryViewer class. 
    - Finish the DirectoryNavigator class to keep up with the changed design. 

Am I blocked on anything?
    - To keep up with the changes in design and backlogs.
